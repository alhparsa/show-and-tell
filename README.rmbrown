I helped research and decide on the models we were going to try and emulate.
Then, I attempted to implement the LSTM-A models alongside Andi. 
After the milestone, we continued to struggle to develop a working model for 
LSTM-A, and so we decided to abandon that part of the project.
I recorded and edited the video for our project.
Lastly, I helped write the abstract, and several sections for the milestone and the final report.
