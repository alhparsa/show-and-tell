As mentioned in the main README, I used debugged muggin's show and tell code and implemented the show and tell model based on his code. Similarly I debugged and implemented the show attend and tell code using sgrvind's code. I also did all the benchmarking and created scripts to run the benchmarks. I also helped with few slides (results and show attend and tell) for the poster session.
