Initially, I was responsible with implementing LSTM-A. After several attempts, I was unable to recreate the model from the paper, and we decided as a team to scrap that section. I was also in charge of making the slideshow (poster) and for presenting the introduction during the presentation. Finally, I wrote the introduction and conclusion, and several other sections of the report. I also did a final proof-read for the paper.
